This is the place where we shared injectable files throughout our server such as database providers and entity services.

# Database
Database folder is where we put the files that connect to our selected database driver.

# Services
Services are based from the Repository pattern of the TypeORM. For more details please see [nest.js documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/sql) in using TypeORM to the nest.js.
